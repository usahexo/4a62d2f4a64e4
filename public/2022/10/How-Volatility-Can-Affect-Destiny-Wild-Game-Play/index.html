      		<h1 id="How-Volatility-Can-Affect-Destiny-Wild-Game-Play"><a href="#How-Volatility-Can-Affect-Destiny-Wild-Game-Play" class="headerlink" title="How Volatility Can Affect Destiny Wild Game Play"></a>How Volatility Can Affect Destiny Wild Game Play</h1><p>Destiny, the latest installment in the Bungie franchise released on September 9, 2014 for Playstation 4 and X-Box One, has already had its share of excitement. Players have taken to the Internet to discuss strategies for leveling up and becoming powerful enough to take on the game’s ultimate enemy: The Darkness.</p>
<p>But what about those players who are more interested in the game’s “casual” content? What about players who just want to enjoy the game’s environment and story? These players may find themselves at a disadvantage when it comes to meeting the high expectations of their peers. This is because Destiny is a very “volatile” game.</p>
<p>Volatility is a measure of how much a particular stock or commodity changes in price over a given period of time. A volatile stock may experience large swings in price both up and down, while a less volatile stock will generally have smaller changes in price.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to Destiny. The game is full of opportunities for players to gain power and advance quickly. But this power can also be lost quickly, especially during the game’s competitive multiplayer mode, “The Crucible.” This makes the game unpredictable and can lead to frustration for casual players who are not used to such volatility.</p>
<p>This volatility can also affect how we play the game. For example, many players have chosen to focus on leveling up their characters rather than acquiring new weapons and gear. This is because weapons and gear can be lost easily during competitive multiplayer matches, while levels cannot be so easily undone. As a result, players are forced to make tough decisions about what items they want to equip their characters with, since they cannot carry all possible items into battle.</p>
<p>This volatility creates an interesting dynamic between the different types of players in Destiny. Hardcore players revel in the challenge of overcoming The Darkness and achieving victory in The Crucible. They appreciate the volatility of the game because it gives them an opportunity to prove their skills against others. Casual players, on the other hand, may find themselves frustrated by the volatility of Destiny and its impact on their ability to progress through the game at their own pace.</p>
<h1 id="What-Determines-Volatility-In-Casino-Games"><a href="#What-Determines-Volatility-In-Casino-Games" class="headerlink" title="What Determines Volatility In Casino Games"></a>What Determines Volatility In Casino Games</h1><h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>A game’s volatility is one of the most important factors to consider when gambling, as it can have a significant impact on how much you lose (or win) overall. In this article, we’ll take a look at what volatility is and how it affects casino games.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Volatility"><a href="#What-is-Volatility" class="headerlink" title="What is Volatility?"></a>What is Volatility?</h2><p>Volatility is a measure of how much a game’s payouts vary in relation to the amount wagered. A high-volatility game will have large swings in winning and losing, while low-volatility games will payout more consistently but with smaller amounts.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, high-volatility games are riskier but also offer the potential for greater rewards. Low-volatility games are less risky but tend to pay out less overall. It’s important to bear in mind that volatility is not indicative of a game’s fairness – all games are completely random, and there is no way to predict which will be more or less volatile.</p>
<h2 id="How-Does-Volatility-Affect-Casino-Games"><a href="#How-Does-Volatility-Affect-Casino-Games" class="headerlink" title="How Does Volatility Affect Casino Games?"></a>How Does Volatility Affect Casino Games?</h2><p>The volatility of a casino game has a direct impact on how much players can expect to win or lose in the long run. High-volatility games tend to have bigger swings in terms of payouts, which means they can go from paying out big wins one round to causing big losses the next. This makes them unsuitable for players who are looking for steady wins over an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Low-volatility games, on the other hand, typically payout more consistently but with smaller amounts. This makes them better suited for players who are looking to avoid risky swings and want a more consistent return on their investment. However, it’s important to note that these games don’t offer the same potential for big payouts as high-volatility titles do.</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Win-More-When-volatility-Is-Low"><a href="#How-To-Win-More-When-volatility-Is-Low" class="headerlink" title="How To Win More When volatility Is Low"></a>How To Win More When volatility Is Low</h1><p>Volatility has been low for most of this year. The S&amp;P 500 Index has had just four 1% moves, compared with 20 in 2017 and an average of 14 over the past 10 years.</p>
<p>What does that mean for your investing strategy?</p>
<p>If you’re like most people, you probably think that low volatility means it’s a good time to buy stocks. After all, when prices are moving less, they must be more likely to move up, right?</p>
<p>Not so fast.</p>
<p>In fact, there is some evidence that stocks perform better when volatility is high. A study by the University of Michigan looked at returns for the S&amp;P 500 Index from 1926 through 2011 and found that stocks generated an annualized return of 10.8% when volatility was high, compared with just 7.4% when volatility was low.1</p>
<p>Why might this be the case? One possible explanation is that when volatility is high, investors are more likely to pay attention to price movements and make changes to their portfolios based on those movements. This could lead to a higher level of stock picking and market movement overall.2</p>
<p>The bottom line: If you want to beat the market, it might be worth looking for opportunities when volatility is high.</p>
<h1 id="Why-volatility-In-Casino-Games-Can-Change"><a href="#Why-volatility-In-Casino-Games-Can-Change" class="headerlink" title="Why volatility In Casino Games Can Change"></a>Why volatility In Casino Games Can Change</h1><p>Gambling and casino games in general are known to have high levels of volatility. But does this volatility always stay the same? Here we take a look at how it can change and what factors might be responsible.</p>
<p>The first thing to consider is that not all casino games are created equal when it comes to volatility. Slots, for example, are typically much more volatile than table games like blackjack or roulette. So while volatility may always be high in gambling as a whole, it can vary from game to game.</p>
<p>Another thing that can affect casino game volatility is the jurisdiction where the game is played. In some cases, casinos will have higher variance slots to attract players who are looking for a bigger thrill. This is particularly common in Las Vegas, where you’ll find some of the most volatile slots around.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s also something to be said for how popular a game is. When a slot machine or game table is busy, the house edge goes down which means the volatility goes up. This is because there’s more chance of winning on a busy machine, but also more chance of losing since the house edge is lower. So if you’re looking for less volatile games, it might be best to avoid the busiest times at the casino.</p>
<p>One other factor that can influence casino game volatility is jackpots. Obviously, the bigger the jackpot, the higher the volatility tends to be since there’s more at stake. This makes sense, as someone who’s playing for a smaller prize isn’t going to experience the same highs and lows as someone playing for a life-changing amount of money. So if you’re after big thrills, look out for games with large jackpots – they’re sure to provide plenty of excitement!</p>
<h1 id="Tips-For-Playing-When-volatility-Is-High"><a href="#Tips-For-Playing-When-volatility-Is-High" class="headerlink" title="Tips For Playing When volatility Is High"></a>Tips For Playing When volatility Is High</h1><p>In a perfect world, we would all be able to sit back and let our account grow without any bumps in the road. Unfortunately, that is not always the case, and at times our lovely investments can send us on a wild roller coaster ride. From time to time we experience high volatility in the markets, which can sometimes scare novice investors away.</p>
<p>For those of you who are new to trading or investing, or for those of you who just want a refresher, here are some tips to help keep you calm and make smart decisions when volatility is high:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Do not let your emotions get the best of you - This is perhaps the most important tip of all. When volatility is high, it is very easy for our emotions to take control and cause us to make irrational decisions. Do your best to stay levelheaded and rational, and remember that doing so will almost always lead to better outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay disciplined - Discipline is key when volatility is high. You need to have a plan and stick to it regardless of what the market is doing. This may require some patience, but it will be worth it in the end.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Have realistic expectations - When volatility is high it is very easy for our biases and preconceived notions about the market to take over. Remember that bull markets do not go up in a straight line and bear markets do not go down in a straight line. Expecting otherwise can lead to disastrous results.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take profits when you can - This one may seem counterintuitive, but sometimes taking profits during periods of high volatility can actually be a good idea. By taking profits you are reducing your risk exposure and ensuring that you will not lose too much money if the market takes a turn for the worse.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use stop losses - Placing stop losses is another great way to reduce your risk exposure during periods of high volatility. By doing so you are essentially telling your broker “If this stock falls below X price I want out”. This gives you peace of mind knowing that if things do go bad you are not going to lose everything you have worked hard for.</p>
</li>
</ol>
