The company has developed some of the most popular casino games available on the internet. While Microgaming is known for its slots games and progressive jackpots, the company also offers a range of table games and video poker variants.</p>
<p>One of Microgaming’s most successful slot machines is Basketball Star. The five-reel, three-row slot machine has an impressive return to player (RTP) rate of 96.57 per cent. The game also offers numerous bonus features, including a rolling reel feature that increases players’ chances of winning big payouts.</p>
<p>As well as Basketball Star, Microgaming’s portfolio includes other sports-themed slots such as Football Star and Cricket Star.
