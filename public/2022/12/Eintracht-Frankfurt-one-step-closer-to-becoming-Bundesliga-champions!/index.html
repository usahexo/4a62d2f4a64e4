<p>The hosts took the lead in the first half when Sebastien Haller’s header found the back of the net. Luka Jovic then doubled their advantage midway through the second half, before Mijat Gacinovic completed the scoring in the closing stages.</p>
<p>Frankfurt now have a five-point cushion at the top of the table with just two games remaining, meaning they are all but guaranteed to be crowned Bundesliga champions for the first time in their history!</p>
<p>Here’s how Frankfurt’s players reacted to their crucial victory on social media:</p>
<p>Sebastien Haller: “We played well and deserved to win. Now we need to focus on our next game and make sure we finish the job.”</p>
<p>Luka Jovic: “We had to work hard for this win, but it was a great feeling to score and help make sure Frankfurt are champions.”</p>
<p>Mijat Gacinovic: “It was a great victory and I’m so happy that we can celebrate together as a team. We’re all focused on getting the job done now.”</p>

Whether you’re a pro or a novice, these tips will help you play blackjack like a pro and boost your chances of winning!</p>
<h1 id="1-Always-Use-Basic-Strategy"><a href="#1-Always-Use-Basic-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="1: Always Use Basic Strategy"></a>1: Always Use Basic Strategy</h1><p>One of the most important things to remember when playing blackjack is to use basic strategy. This is a simple system that can help you make the best decisions for your hand, which will give you the best chance of winning. You can find basic strategy charts online, or in books, and it’s worth taking the time to learn it inside out.</p>
<h1 id="2-Know-Your-Odds"><a href="#2-Know-Your-Odds" class="headerlink" title="2: Know Your Odds"></a>2: Know Your Odds</h1><p>Another thing to keep in mind when playing blackjack is your odds. As with any casino game, blackjack has odds that favour the house, so it’s important to be aware of them and know when to walk away from the table. For example, if the odds are poor on a hand, it might be wise to surrender rather than risk losing more money.</p>
<h1 id="3-Don’t-Chase-Losses"><a href="#3-Don’t-Chase-Losses" class="headerlink" title="3: Don’t Chase Losses"></a>3: Don’t Chase Losses</h1><p>One of the biggest mistakes players can make is chasing their losses. When you start losing money at the blackjack table, it can be tempting to keep betting in order to try and win it back, but this is a recipe for disaster. Ultimately, you’re more likely to lose even more money this way, so it’s best to quit while you’re ahead.</p>
<h1 id="4-Use-Mental-Math"><a href="#4-Use-Mental-Math" class="headerlink" title="4: Use Mental Math"></a>4: Use Mental Math</h1><p>Mental math is an essential skill for blackjack players. This involves doing calculations in your head rather than using pen and paper, and it can help you make better decisions during the game. By being able to quickly calculate your odds and possible outcomes, you can make informed choices about how to play each hand.</p>
<h1 id="5-Take-Your-Time"><a href="#5-Take-Your-Time" class="headerlink" title="5: Take Your Time"></a>5: Take Your Time</h1><p>Finally, remember that blackjack is a game that should be enjoyed – so take your time and don’t rush into decisions. There’s no need to feel under pressure; simply take your time and think through each move before making a decision. This will help improve your chances of winning at blackjack!</p>

<h1 id="Learn-how-to-beat-the-odds-at-blackjack-with-Eintracht-Frankfurt"><a href="#Learn-how-to-beat-the-odds-at-blackjack-with-Eintracht-Frankfurt" class="headerlink" title="Learn how to beat the odds at blackjack with Eintracht Frankfurt!"></a>Learn how to beat the odds at blackjack with Eintracht Frankfurt!</h1><p>Do you love the thrill of gambling and trying to beat the odds? If so, blackjack is the perfect game for you! Mastering this game can be tricky, but with a little bit of practice you can start winning more often than you lose.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to improve your blackjack skills is to learn from a professional. Eintracht Frankfurt is a German football club that has a team of experts who can teach you how to play blackjack like a pro. In this article, we will cover some of the basics of blackjack so that you can start playing today!</p>
<p>The goal of blackjack is very simple – to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The first player to reach 21 or whose score is higher than the dealer’s wins the hand. The beauty of blackjack is that there are many different ways to win, and as long as you make better decisions than the dealer, you have a good chance of coming out on top.</p>
<p>One thing to remember when playing blackjack is that you should always stand when your cards total 17 or more. This way, you reduce the risk of going bust (going over 21). If the dealer has a low card (2 through 6), feel free to take another card in hopes of getting closer to 21. However, if the dealer has a high card (7 through Ace), it’s usually best to stick with what you have.</p>
<p>When it comes to betting, it’s important to know your odds. In general, it’s wise to bet smaller amounts when your chances of winning are lower, and bet more when your chances are better. One strategy that can help increase your odds of winning is called doubling down. This simply means that instead of betting one chip, you double your bet and receive just one more card. So if you have an 11 and the dealer has a 2 showing, doubling down would be smart since there’s only a one in four chance that the dealer will beat you.</p>
<p>Now that you know some basic tips for playing blackjack, why not try out Eintracht Frankfurt’s online casino? Not only will you learn how to play like a pro, but you can also enjoy some great bonuses along the way!</p>

<p>The great thing about playing blackjack at an online casino is that you can take your time to learn the game and perfect your strategy before risking any real money. And, when you’re ready to up the stakes, there are plenty of top online casinos waiting to reward you with juicy bonuses and promotions.</p>
<p>So, if you want to join the ranks of the blackjack pros, read on for our top tips and tricks!</p>
<h1 id="1-Practice-makes-perfect"><a href="#1-Practice-makes-perfect" class="headerlink" title="1: Practice makes perfect"></a>1: Practice makes perfect</h1><p>No matter how much you may know about blackjack strategy, there’s no substitute for practice. So be sure to play a few hands at home before hitting the casino floor – or better still, sign up for a free account at one of our recommended casinos and play for real money. This will help you get used to the game interface and develop your own winning strategies.</p>
<h1 id="2-Start-small"><a href="#2-Start-small" class="headerlink" title="2: Start small"></a>2: Start small</h1><p>It’s always a good idea to start small when playing any casino game – and blackjack is no exception. Don’t be tempted to bet big from the get-go; instead, start with smaller bets and increase them as you become more confident in your abilities. This will help you stay in the game longer if things don’t go your way, and also minimise your potential losses.</p>
<h1 id="3-Play-smart"><a href="#3-Play-smart" class="headerlink" title="3: Play smart"></a>3: Play smart</h1><p>One of the biggest mistakes novice blackjack players make is trying to hit 21 on every hand. While this may seem like a surefire way to win, it’s actually not very smart strategy – especially if the dealer is showing a strong hand himself. Instead, aim to get as close to 21 as possible without going over, and remember that two cards of the same value (e.g. two kings) are considered 21 points anyway.</p>
<h1 id="4-Know-when-to-fold-‘em"><a href="#4-Know-when-to-fold-‘em" class="headerlink" title="4: Know when to fold ‘em"></a>4: Know when to fold ‘em</h1><p>If you find yourself constantly losing money on blackjack hands, it might be time to fold ‘em and walk away from the table. Remember – there’s no shame in admitting defeat; after all, gambling should always be fun! So if things aren’t going your way and you don’t feel comfortable playing any longer, just cash out and call it a day.</p>
