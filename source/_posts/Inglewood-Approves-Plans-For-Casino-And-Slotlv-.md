#  Inglewood Approves Plans For Casino And Slotlv 

The city council of Inglewood, California has unanimously voted in favor of a casino and resort development that will include a $2.5 billion hotel and casino complex. The new development, which is to be built by the Las Vegas-based company Slotlv, will also include a convention center, 2,500 residential units, and retail space. 

Slotlv’s CEO, Bill Hornbuckle, was understandably thrilled with the news. “Inglewood is a key market for us and this is a great opportunity to bring our world-class brand to one of the most important cities in the United States.” Hornbuckle went on to say that the project would create over 10,000 jobs and that the company was already working on designs for the project. 

Not everyone is happy about the prospect of a new casino opening in Inglewood, however. Some residents are worried about traffic congestion and crime rates going up in the area. But with an estimated economic impact of $3 billion annually, it’s clear that the benefits of this new development outweigh any potential negatives. 

Construction on the new casino and resort is expected to begin early next year and it should be open for business by 2021. So if you’re looking for a place to gamble in Los Angeles, you may soon have a new option – Inglewood!
