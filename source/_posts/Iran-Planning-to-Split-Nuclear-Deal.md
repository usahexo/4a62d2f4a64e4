#  Iran Planning to Split Nuclear Deal

Iran is planning to split the nuclear deal it reached with world powers, a senior official said on Wednesday, in a new challenge to the pact which U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to abandon.

The Islamic Republic could use European help to circumvent renewed U.S. sanctions, but would stop short of renegotiating the 2015 deal that curbed its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief, Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said.

“We will stick to our side of the bargain as long as the other party sticks to theirs ... But if they violate (the pact), we will immediately react,” Araqchi said in a speech broadcast live on state television.

Trump has given the European signatories a May 12 deadline to “fix the terrible flaws” in the deal or he will refuse to extend U.S. sanctions relief on Iran related to oil sales which are due to expire in July.

European powers see the nuclear agreement as vital for preventing Iran from developing a nuclear bomb and have been trying to persuade Trump not to renege on it.

#  Iran Threatens to Split Deal

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has threatened to split the 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers if the United States re-imposes sanctions.

"If America want to go back to the experience (of sanction), Iran would certainly return in a short time -- not a week or a month but within hours -- to conditions much more advanced than before the nuclear deal," Rouhani said in a speech broadcast on state television.

The Iranian president's comments come as Washington tries to win support from European allies for re-imposing sanctions that were lifted as part of the nuclear agreement. U.S. President Donald Trump has set a May 12 deadline for Europe to "fix the terrible flaws" of the accord, or he will pull out of it.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif warned on Monday that any attempt by Trump to scrap the nuclear deal would isolate Washington rather than Tehran.

"If the United States leaves the nuclear deal, then Iran will be left with no choice but to resume its nuclear program more seriously than before," Zarif said on state television.

#  Hassan Rouhani Threatens to Split Nuclear Deal

Hassan Rouhani threatened to split the nuclear deal with France, Germany, and the United Kingdom if they continue to impose sanctions on Iran. The president of Iran stated that his country would resume its nuclear program if the members of the European Union failed to lift their sanctions.

Rouhani made his comments in a televised speech on Wednesday. He said that the Iranian people have shown great patience over the past year, but they will not tolerate any more sanctions. The president added that Iran will give the three European countries a 60-day deadline to comply with their commitments under the nuclear deal. If they don’t, Iran will start enriching uranium again.

Earlier in the week, foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif warned that Iran could also restart its heavy water reactor at Arak. He said that this would be done in response to the new U.S. sanctions that were imposed on Monday. The Trump administration reimposed sanctions on Iran after it pulled out of the nuclear deal in May.

The renewed sanctions have caused economic hardship for Iranians, who are already struggling with high inflation and unemployment. Many people took to the streets to protest against the government’s decision to pull out of the nuclear deal.

#  Iran Vows to Split Nuclear Agreement If Sanctions Are Reimposed

The Iranian government has vowed to discontinue its compliance with the nuclear agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) if the United States reimposes sanctions against the Islamic Republic. This announcement comes just days after President Trump announced that he would be withdrawing from the JCPOA, and reimposing sanctions on Iran that were lifted as part of the agreement.

In a speech delivered on Monday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said that his country would no longer adhere to the limits set by the JCPOA on its uranium enrichment and stockpiling of nuclear material. Zarif also threatened to resume production of heavy water, a key component in the production of nuclear weapons.

"If the United States re-imposes sanctions, then Iran will have no choice but to stop complying with all its obligations under the nuclear deal," Zarif said.

Zarif's defiant statement is likely to further exacerbate tensions between Iran and the United States, which deteriorated rapidly after Trump's announcement last week. In response to Trump's decision, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani lashed out at the U.S., saying that it was a "psychological war" and that Iran would continue to abide by its commitments under the JCPOA.

The reimposition of U.S. sanctions will have a devastating impact on Iran's economy, which is already reeling from high unemployment and rampant inflation. The sanctions will also restrict Iran's ability to conduct international trade, and could cause foreign companies doing business in Iran to pull out of their contracts.

#  Iran Could Split Nuclear Agreement If Sanctions Are Imposed

The Iranian president has warned that the country could split from the nuclear agreement if new sanctions are imposed by the United States.

Speaking at a gathering of officials in Tehran, Hassan Rouhani said that Iran would continue to honor the agreement as long as its benefits outweighed the costs. However, he said that if new US sanctions were to damage Iran's economy, then the country would have to "react decisively and resolutely."

The warning comes as Washington is re-imposing sanctions on Iran that had been lifted under the 2015 nuclear agreement. The Trump administration withdrew from the agreement in May, arguing that it was too weak and needed to be replaced with a stronger deal.

Rouhani warned that any attempt to create a rift between Iran and Europe would be unsuccessful. "We have a good relationship with Europe and we must maintain our relations with Europe," he said. "If America imposes sanctions on Iran and our relations with Europe sour, we will have to sell our oil and gas somewhere."

The Iranian president also accused the US of attempting to sabotage the agreement by pressuring other countries not to do business with Iran. He said this was part of a broader effort by Washington to isolate Iran and destroy its economy.
