#  NJ Finally Greenlights Sports Betting Promitheas

The wait is over. New Jersey has finally taken the plunge and enacted legislation authorizing sports betting in the state. Governor Phil Murphy signed the bill into law this morning, paving the way for widespread gaming at racetracks and casinos throughout NJ.

The new law specifically authorizes bets on professional and collegiate sporting events, as well as parlay and proposition wagers. The list of eligible sporting events is long and varied, including everything from NFL games to horse races.

Despite strong opposition from the NCAA and major league sports teams, lawmakers in NJ were determined to bring sports betting to their residents. “It’s time to bring this multibillion-dollar industry out of the dark ages,” said Democratic state senator Raymond Lesniak when the bill was first introduced. “This is a common-sense reform that will create jobs, increase tourism and generate much-needed revenue for our state.”

Now that the bill has been enacted, it will be up to the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement to set up the regulations for licensing and operation of sports betting facilities. It is expected that this process will take some time, so eager bettors may have to wait a while before placing their first bets. However, with this new law in place, sports gaming is now officially legal in NJ.

#  NJ Sports Betting Promitheas to Begin Within Weeks

After the US Supreme Court struck down the federal ban on sports gambling, each state is now taking the lead in determining how to allow it.  New Jersey is among the first and has pledged to have betting within weeks.

This is good news for NJ residents, who can now legally bet on their favorite teams. There are already a few online sportsbooks accepting NJ players, and more are expected to open up in the coming weeks.

If you're new to sports betting, don't worry – we're here to help. In this article, we'll explain everything you need to know about NJ sports betting, including how to get started and the types of bets you can make.

How to Bet on Sports in NJ

The first step is registering with an online sportsbook. This process is simple and only takes a few minutes. Just provide some basic information like your name and email address, then confirm your account by clicking on a link sent to your email address.

Once you've registered with an online sportsbook, you'll need to fund your account. Most sites accept a variety of payment methods, including Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal. You can then start betting on your favorite teams!

There are two ways to place a wager: pre-match or live betting. With pre-match betting, you place your bet before the game starts. With live betting, also known as in-play betting, you can place bets during the game itself. This can be a fun way to add excitement to the action!

The most common types of bets include head-to-head match bets, point spreads, totals (also known as over/unders), and props (or special bets). We'll go over each of these bets in more detail below.

Head-to-Head Match Bets

A head-to-head match bet is simply a bet on which team will win the game. You can wager on either the home team or the away team. The odds vary depending on which team is favored. For example, if Manchester United is playing against Chelsea FC, Manchester United might be favored at 2/1 odds while Chelsea FC might be at 2/1 odds as well (meaning they are an equal underdog). If you think Manchester United will win, you would wager $10 in hopes of winning $30 (plus your original $10 back). If Chelsea FC wins instead, you would lose your $10 stake.

Point Spreads

A point spread is a type of wager where you bet that one team will beat another by a certain number of points or more. For example, let's say that Arsenal is playing against Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal is favored by 3 points. This means that if you bet on Arsenal and they win by 4 or more points, you would win; if they only win by 3 points or less (or lose outright), you would lose your bet. The odds vary depending on how large the point spread is; larger point spreads mean bigger potential payouts but also longer odds for the underdog (since they have more ground to make up). In our example above, if Tottenham Hotspur upset Arsenal by winning outright or losing by just 1 point, Tottenham would be paying out at 11/2 odds while Arsenal would still be favored at even money (1/1). Point spreads can also be combined with totals bets – for example, if there was an over/under total set at 2 goals for this match and you placed a wager on OVER 2 goals without mentioning any particular side (Arsenal or Tottenham), then it would automatically become a bet against Tottenham Hotspur (since they would have to beat Arsenal by 3 goals or more for your wager to payout).

 Totals Bets ("Over/Unders")



 A totals bet is simply a wager on whether the total number of goals scored in a game will be over or under a certain number set by the bookmaker. Let's say that Liverpool is playing against Everton and both teams are scoring heavily lately – Bookmaker X sets the total number of goals at 5 for this match . So if you think there will be more than 5 goals scored in this match ,you'd place a " OVER 5" bet . Conversely , if u think there will be fewer than 5 goals scored ,you'd place an "UNDER 5" bet . In this particular matchup , Liverpool are slight favorites so UNDER 5 may payout better than OVER 5 .

 

 Props ("Special Bets") 

Proposition bets or "props" are special wagers offered by bookmakers on unique outcomes not directly related to the final outcome of a game . For example ,a bookmaker may offer props such as " Which player will score first ? " Or " Will there be any red cards issued ? ". These type of bets tend to have longer odds but can offer much higher payouts depending

#  NJ Approves Sports Betting Promitheas; Operators Could be up and Running in Days

On May 14, the New Jersey state Assembly approved a bill to allow sports betting in the state, sending the measure to Governor Phil Murphy for his expected signature. According to published reports, Murphy indicated he would sign the bill, possibly as early as this week. The bill would legalize sports betting at the state's casinos and racetracks, as well as through mobile devices.

Assuming Murphy signs the bill, it could be just days before operations are up and running. Monmouth Park Racetrack has already announced its plans to start taking sports bets on Thursday, May 24.

The move by New Jersey comes after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had prohibited most states from authorizing sports betting. In its ruling in May 2018, the Supreme Court said that the federal law violated states' rights under the 10th Amendment of the Constitution.

Since then, several other states have moved to legalize sports betting, including Delaware, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. It's estimated that there could be $150 billion in legal sports wagers in the U.S. each year, once all states have legalized gambling.

Nevada has been the only state where sports betting has been legal since 1991. In order for New Jersey's Monmouth Park Racetrack to take bets on Thursday, it must first receive authorization from the New Jersey Racing Commission.

#  NJ Sports Betting Promitheas Gets Final Approval

The long wait is finally over. NJ sports betting enthusiasts will soon be able to place their bets on their favorite teams. The Monmouth Park Racetrack has been given the final approval to offer sports betting. This comes after the Supreme Court’s ruling in May that opened up sports betting nationwide.

There has been much anticipation for this day and there is no doubt that Monmouth Park will be busy in the coming days. There are many different ways that people can bet on sports and Monmouth Park will offer them all. You can bet on individual games or you can bet on matchups between teams. You can also bet on the outcome of entire tournaments.

There are a number of different ways to place your bets at Monmouth Park. You can use a computer or you can use your phone. You can also place your bets in person at the track or you can call one of the many toll-free numbers. There are even several websites that allow you to bet on sports without having to leave your house.

One thing that is important to note is that not everyone will be able to place bets at Monmouth Park Racetrack. Only those who are located within New Jersey will be able to participate. This may change in the future, but for now, only those who are physically located in the state will be able to take part in sports betting activities.

It remains to be seen how popular NJ sports betting will be, but there is no doubt that there is a lot of excitement about it. Whether you are a fan of football, baseball, basketball, or any other sport, there is a good chance that you will be able to find a way to bet on it at Monmouth Park Racetrack.
