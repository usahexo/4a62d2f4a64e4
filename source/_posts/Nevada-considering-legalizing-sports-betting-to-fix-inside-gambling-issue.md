#  Nevada considering legalizing sports betting to fix inside gambling issue

Nevada is the only state in the US that allows single game betting. Because of this, they have seen a decline in gambling revenue from sports wagering in casinos. In order to address this issue, the Nevada Gaming Policy Committee is considering legalizing sports betting within the state.

The reason for the decline is twofold. First, many people are now placing their bets online or through offshore operators, which is illegal in Nevada. Second, bettors are increasingly making so-called "parlay" bets that combine multiple games into one wager, which offer much better odds but pay out less money if successful.

According to a study by the University of Las Vegas, legalizing sports betting could lead to a $123 million increase in gaming revenue each year. This would help offset the $1.3 billion in losses that casinos experienced last year from other types of gambling such as blackjack and slots.

It is not yet clear howsuch a proposal would be enacted, or whether it would require a change in federal law. However, supporters believe that it would be a win-win situation for both the state and its casino industry.

#  FBI investigation finds that inside gambling is rampant in the NBA

The FBI released the findings of a three-year investigation into gambling in the NBA on Tuesday and the report makes for some damning reading. According to the report, there is widespread betting on games inside the league, with over $500 million wagered on last season’s games alone. The FBI also claims that a number of current and former players have been involved in gambling activities, with some even using their position within the league to fix games.

Of course, it is not illegal to bet on games in the United States, but the FBI’s report is sure to raise concerns about the level of corruption within the NBA. The findings will also be worrying for the league’s commissioner Adam Silver, who has been outspoken about his desire to see sports betting legalized in America. Silver has argued that regulated sports betting would help protect against corruption, but it is hard to see how this latest report strengthens his argument.

It is not just the NBA that is facing scrutiny from the FBI’s findings. The report also claims that there is widespread gambling in college basketball, with over $100 million wagered on last season’s games. This has led to concerns that some players are being paid to throw games and that teams are being bribed to fix matchups. The NCAA has already announced an investigation into these allegations and it looks like they could be in for a long and difficult process.

So far, no one has been accused of any wrongdoing by the FBI and all of the allegations are still just rumors. However, it is clear that there is a serious problem with gambling in American sport and that something needs to be done about it. The NBA and NCAA both need to take action to ensure that their games are clean and fair for all fans, regardless of whether they are betting on them or not.

#  Congress may consider legislation to legalize online gambling to help fix the inside gambling problem

A new bill has been introduced in Congress that would legalize online gambling in the United States. The goal of the proposed bill is to help fix the growing problem of illegal gambling inside casinos.

Illegal gambling has been a problem for casinos for many years. It can be difficult to detect and prevent, and often results in lost revenue for casinos. Online gambling could help to address this issue by allowing casinos to offer gambling games online. This would make it easier to monitor and regulate gambling activity, and would help to reduce the amount of illegal gambling happening inside casinos.

 legalizing online gambling will also provide additional revenue for casinos, which can be used to create jobs and support other casino operations. In addition, it will allow casinos to compete with offshore operators who are currently offering online gambling services illegally in the United States.

There are some concerns that legalizing online gambling could lead to more problem gambling behavior. However, studies have shown that most people who gamble online do so responsibly, and that the benefits of legalized online gambling outweigh the risks.

Congress is expected to consider this legislation in the near future. If it is passed, it will be up to individual states to decide whether or not to implement online gambling programs.

#  Bill Gates donates $1 million towards finding a solution to fix inside gambling

Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft and one of the richest people in the world, has donated $1 million to a research project that is looking for a solution to stop problem gambling within casinos.

The donation was made through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is focused on improving healthcare and reducing poverty around the world. The research project will be run by The University of British Columbia and Simon Fraser University in Vancouver.

It is hoped that the research will help to develop new technologies and strategies that can be used to identify problem gamblers who are at risk of developing a gambling addiction before they enter a casino. This would then allow these people to be provided with support and treatment before it becomes too late.

Christopher Casselman, a professor at The University of British Columbia, said that: “This gift from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will allow us not only to continue our ground-breaking work in identifying risk factors for problem gambling but also to test potential interventions in an experimental setting”.

He added that there is currently no cure for gambling addiction and that it is hoped that this research will help to change that. Problem gambling is known to cause significant financial, social and emotional problems for those affected by it.

The $1 million donation from Bill Gates comes just weeks after he announced that he was giving away half of his wealth as part of the Giving Pledge campaign. This campaign was launched by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates in 2010 and aims to get wealthy people to donate their money to charity.

#  Researchers develop new algorithm to detect fixed matches in online gambling

A team of researchers from the University of Leicester has developed a new algorithm to detect fixed matches in online gambling.

The new algorithm, which is called Proteus, was specifically designed to identify suspicious betting patterns that could be indicative of match fixing.

"Match fixing is a growing concern in online gambling and one that we wanted to address with our research," said Dr. Muhammad Adnan, who led the research team. "Proteus is the first algorithm of its kind that can be used to quickly and accurately identify fixed matches."

The team tested Proteus on a data set comprised of over 1 million bets placed on football matches. The algorithm was able to identify fixed matches with a high degree of accuracy.

"This research is an important step forward in the fight against match fixing," said Dr. Adnan. "It provides online gambling operators with a tool they can use to quickly and accurately identify fixed matches."
