#  Riverwind Casino now offers thrilling Baccarat M3 game 

The Riverwind Casino is one of the most popular gambling destinations in Oklahoma. The casino has now announced that it will be offering a new, more thrilling version of the game Baccarat. The new game, called Baccarat M3, offers players a more dynamic and exciting experience.

The new game has three betting boxes: Player, Tie, and Banker. In traditional Baccarat, there are only two betting boxes: Player and Banker. The addition of the Tie box makes the game more exciting by providing players with more opportunities to win.

The Banker box pays out at even odds, while the Player and Tie boxes both pay out at odds of 9 to 1. So, if you bet on the Banker and it wins, you'll get your original bet back plus an additional 9 units. If you bet on the Player and it wins, you'll get back 9 units plus your original bet. And if you bet on the Tie and it wins, you'll get back 18 units plus your original bet.

There is also a side wager available in Baccarat M3 called Perfect Pairs. This wager pays out at odds of 25 to 1 if two cards of the same rank are dealt (e.g., two kings). It pays out at odds of 12 to 1 if two cards of the same suit are dealt.
