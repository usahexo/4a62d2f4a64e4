#  Walk off your bingo wings with weights!

Do you know the feeling? You have been eating a little too much over the festive period and now your clothes are feeling a little tighter. So, what do you do?
a) You hit the gym and start punishing yourself with a gruelling workout regime in a bid to whittle away those excess pounds as quickly as possible.
b) You accept that your wardrobe is now slightly too tight for your comfort and resign yourself to buying some new clothes at the end of your weight loss journey.
c) You walk off your bingo wings with weights!

Now, before you write this off as another crazy fitness fad, hear me out. Wearing weights while walking can actually help to speed up weight loss, sculpting your body into the shape you have always wanted in the process. In fact, research has shown that when overweight women wore ankle weights while walking, they lost three times more weight than those who didn’t wear any weights at all.

So how does it work? Well, by wearing weights while walking, you are forced to use more energy in order to move around. This extra energy expenditure helps to burn more calories and promote weight loss. Not only that, but wearing weights also helps to tone and sculpt muscles, giving you a leaner look overall.

If you are looking for an easy way to lose weight and get toned without having to spend hours in the gym each day, then wearing weights while walking is definitely worth considering. Start off by wearing a relatively light weight (around 1-2 pounds), and gradually increase the amount of weight you are wearing as you get stronger. Just make sure that you are comfortable with the amount of weight you are carrying – you don’t want to end up with an injury!

So there you have it – walking off your bingo wings with weights is a great way to achieve your weight loss goals without having to spend hours in the gym. Give it a go today and see how you get on!

#  Bingo wings? No problem!

Most women are self-conscious about their arms, specifically the area around the elbow and shoulder known as the “bingo wings”. This is a common problem area for many people, not just women. But thankfully, there are exercises you can do to help reduce the appearance of bingo wings and make your arms look more toned and defined.

One great exercise for targeting this area is the tricep extension. To do this exercise, hold a weight in each hand with your palms facing down. Extend your arms straight in front of you, then slowly lower them back to the starting position. Be sure to keep your back straight and don’t let your elbows bend too much. You can also do this exercise with resistance bands for an even greater challenge.

Another great exercise for toning and tightening up your arms is the overhead press. For this exercise, you will need a weight or resistance band. Start by standing with your feet hip-width apart and hold the weight or band above your head with your palms facing each other. Exhale as you push the weight or band overhead, then inhale as you lower it back to the starting position. Make sure to keep your back straight and don’t let your elbows go too far out to the sides.

These are just a few examples of exercises that can help reduce the appearance of bingo wings. Be sure to add these (and other) exercises into your regular routine and you will start seeing results in no time!

#  Drop those bingo wings and tone up arms with weights!

As we age, our muscles tend to shrink and our metabolism slows down. This leads to that dreaded accumulation of fat around the arms and upper body, often referred to as “bingo wings”. But don’t despair – there are exercises you can do to tone up your arms and get rid of those bingo wings for good!

One great way to tone your arms is by lifting weights. Lifting weights not only builds muscle, but it also helps burn fat. Start out by doing light weights – you don’t want to overload your muscles and risk injury. As you get stronger, you can gradually increase the weight.

Another great way to tone your arms is with aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise such as swimming, biking or running helps to burn calories and shed fat. As with weightlifting, start out with light exercises and work your way up as you get stronger.

If you’re finding it difficult to tone up your arms on your own, consider hiring a personal trainer. A personal trainer can help design an exercise program specifically for you that will help tone up your arms and reduce the appearance of bingo wings.
