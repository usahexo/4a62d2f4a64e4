# Regulations
Since gambling began centuries ago, societies have strived to create regulations around it so it can exist within society without causing too many issues. Gambling laws vary from country to country and even state to state within countries like the United States. In some cases, casinos are allowed to generate their own regulations while other times they must adhere to stricter rules set forth by a governing body such as a national lottery commission or gaming authority. 


Casinos have been present in many parts of the world for centuries and remain one of the most popular forms of entertainment available today.

#  What is Iran?

The Islamic Republic of Iran is a country located in Western Asia. It has a population of around 81 million and is the 18th largest country in the world by area. The official language is Persian, which is also the mother tongue of around 55% of the population.

Iran is a constitutional republic with a president, parliament, and judiciary. The president is elected by popular vote for a four-year term and limited to two terms. The parliament, called the Majles, has 290 members who are elected for four-year terms. The judiciary is independent of the other branches of government.

These laws have been criticized by human rights groups for infringing on freedom of expression and assembly, and for discriminating against women and religious minorities.

#  Who knows the answer to question 1-4?

To paraphrase a bit of the great philosopher Ferris Bueller, "life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it."

This sentiment is never more true than when it comes to the world of investing. In a landscape that is constantly changing, it's important for investors to stay on their toes and continue learning as much as they can about the market.

Unfortunately, this is easier said than done. With so much information available at our fingertips, it can be tough to know where to start - let alone what's worth paying attention to.

Luckily, we're here to help. In this article, we'll be answering four questions that are commonly asked by investors. By the time you finish reading, you'll have a better understanding of:

1) What factors influence stock prices?
2) What is meant by a 'bull' and 'bear' market?
3) How do I pick the right stocks for my portfolio?
4) What should I do if I lose money on my investments?

             FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE STOCK PRICES
There are countless factors that can influence stock prices on any given day. However, there are four main drivers that tend to have the biggest impact: earnings, dividends, price-to-earnings (P/E ratios), and company size. Here's a quick overview of each:

1) Earnings: Corporate profits account for the vast majority of stock prices movements. When a company announces strong quarterly earnings, its stock price typically goes up; when it reports poor earnings, its stock price usually goes down. This makes sense when you think about it; after all, shareholders want to see their investment doing well financially!
2) Dividends: A company's willingness to pay out dividends - i.e., distribute a portion of its profits back to shareholders - is another important indicator of its overall financial health. The higher the dividend yield (the percentage of the share price paid out in dividends annually), the more attractive a stock may be to investors.
3) P/E ratios: One measure of how expensive or cheap a stock is relative to others is its P/E ratio. This number is calculated by dividing the share price by earnings per share (EPS). Generally speaking, stocks with high P/E ratios are considered more expensive than those with low P/E ratios; however, there are many other factors to consider before making any investment decisions!
4) Company size: Another factor that can affect stock prices is company size - or more specifically, market capitalization (market cap). This term refers to the total value of all outstanding shares of a particular company. Larger companies tend to have more volatile stock prices than smaller companies, as they are often seen as riskier investments.
