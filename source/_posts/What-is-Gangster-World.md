#  How to play Gangster World?

Gangster World is a massively multiplayer online game that you can play on your computer or mobile device. In the game, you can choose to be a gangster, police officer, or civilian. Each character has different missions and goals to achieve in the game.

The first step is to create an account and download the game. Once you have done that, open the game and select your character. You will then be taken to the map of the city. The goal of the game is to complete missions and earn points. You can unlock new missions by progressing through the ranks.

As a gangster, your primary goal is to make money and build your gang. You can do this by completing missions, selling drugs, and robbing businesses. Police officers have a different goal – they are tasked with fighting crime and keeping order in the city. Civilians simply want to live their lives and avoid getting caught up in the violence of the city.

The gameplay is quite simple – you use the arrow keys or joystick to move around, and the ‘W’ key or button to interact with objects. There are also various buttons on the screen that allow you to access your weapons, health bar, money, etc.

One of the best things about Gangster World is that it is free-to-play. This means that you can enjoy all of the action without having to spend any money. However, there are also some in-game items that can be purchased with real-world currency if you wish to speed up your progress.
