#  What are the Los Angeles Rams?

The Los Angeles Rams are a professional American football team based in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The Rams compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) West division. The team plays its home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, California.

The franchise entered the NFL in 1936 as the Cleveland Rams, located in Cleveland, Ohio. The club was owned by Homer Marshman and featured quarterback Bob Waterfield and halfback Glenn Davis. The Rams took the field for the first time on September 10, 1936, beating the Pittsburgh Pirates 21–0.

In 1945, reigning NFL champion Chicago Cardinals moved to St. Louis and were renamed the St. Louis Cardinals. As a result, the Cleveland Rams acquired their current name, accepting an offer from Carroll Rosenbloom to move to Baltimore, Maryland, where they became the Baltimore Colts. In 1953, following years of poor play and attendance, Marshall merged his franchise with that of minority owner Eugene Klein to form Anthony Morabito's American Football Conference (AFC).

Marshall suffered a heart attack soon after and died in 1955. His estate would sell controlling interest of the team to Rosenbloom, who would then merge his Colts with the old Houston Oilers of the newly-formed American Football League (AFL) to form an umbrella organization known as the AFL–NFL merger agreement. This move made Rosenbloom owner of both franchises. After struggling financially while in Baltimore, Rosenbloom successfully convinced NFL owners to allow him to move his teams back to Los Angeles in time for the 1980 season.

The Rams began playing home games at Anaheim Stadium in Anaheim, California in 1980 and played there until 1994 when they moved to Stade Olympique de la Pont de Quebec in Montreal following Stade Olympique's demolition. The team returned westward to Los Angeles prior to the 2016 season.

#  What is Brasileiro Serie A?

The Brasileiro Serie A, commonly known as simply Serie A, is the top level professional men’s football league in Brazil. It was founded in 1959 and is currently contested by twenty clubs. The Brasileiro Serie A is ranked sixth in the world by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS).

The Brasileiro Serie A is a very prestigious competition, and clubs from all around Brazil compete fiercely to be crowned champions. The top four clubs at the end of the season qualify for the prestigious Copa Libertadores tournament, while the fifth-placed club enters into a play-off against the winner of the Campeonato Paulista (the top-level state championship in Brazil) for a place in next year's Libertadores.

The Brasileiro Serie A is one of only two leagues in South America which are classified as ' UEFA 5 Star leagues ', along with La Liga in Spain. This means that Brazilian clubs have been able to compete in the lucrative UEFA Champions League and Europa League competitions in recent years. Cruzeiro and Palmeiras are among the most successful Brazilian clubs in these tournaments, having both reached the semi-finals of the Champions League.

The current champions of the Brasileiro Serie A are Grêmio, who won their first title since 1995 last season. They will be hoping to defend their crown this year and add to their record haul of eight championship titles.
