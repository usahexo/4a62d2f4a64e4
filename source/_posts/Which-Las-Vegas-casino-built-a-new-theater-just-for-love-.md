Aquila Basket Trento is a professional basketball team which is located in the city of Trento, Italy. The team was founded back in 1966, and they have been playing in the Italian League since their inception. Aquila Basket Trento is one of the most historic and successful teams within Italian professional basketball, having won a total of nine league championships, and five national cups.

This year however, Aquila Basket Trento has ventured out to new territory by competing in the inaugural edition of the MGM Resorts’ NBA Summer League.

Particularly impressive has been the play of American forward Alec Peters, who is currently leading the team in scoring with an average of 17 points per game.

The team’s success in Las Vegas has not gone unnoticed by its home fans either, with many spectators travelling to Nevada to support their club. One such fan, Claudio Bonacini, decided that he wanted to do something special for his team and organized a bus trip for over 50 fellow supporters from Trento to Las Vegas. As Bonacini put it, “Seeing our boys compete live in Sin City was just too good an opportunity to miss!”

#  Which casino is getting into the theater business? 

The Wynn casino in Las Vegas has announced its plans to open a theater on the premises. It will be the latest entertainment venture for the company, which already operates a resort and two theaters in Macau.

The new theater in Las Vegas is set to open in late 2019 and will seat more than 1,700 people. It will be designed by world-famous architect Thomas Heatherwick, who has created theaters all over the world, including the Globe Theatre in London and the Park Avenue Armory in New York City.

According to Steve Wynn, Chairman and CEO of Wynn Resorts, "This new theater will be unlike anything else currently available in Las Vegas. Our goal is to create an intimate and unparalleled experience that engages all of the senses and transports guests into another world."

# What kind of shows will be available at the Wynn Theater? 

So far, it's not clear what types of shows will be presented at the Wynn Theater. However, given Heatherwick's experience with both classical and contemporary theater productions, it's likely that a wide range of performances will be available.

In addition to traditional theater shows, it's also possible that the Wynn Theater will feature musicals, circus acts, or other forms of live entertainment. Whatever ends up being offered, it's sure to be impressive given the caliber of both Heatherwick and Wynn.

# How does this compare to other theaters in Las Vegas? 

There are already several large theaters in Las Vegas, including The Colosseum at Caesars Palace and The Venetian Theatre. However, the Wynn Theater is expected to be significantly larger than any of these venues.

It's also worth noting that many of the other theaters in Las Vegas are associated with specific resorts or hotel brands. For example, The Mirage has its own theatre venue while The Bellagio features an opera house. By contrast, the Wynn Theater will be open to everyone regardless of where they're staying in Las Vegas.
